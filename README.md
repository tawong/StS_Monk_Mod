# StS Monk Mod
Adds an optional 4th playable character to Slay The Spire. It adds 77 new cards, and 11 new relics to the game.

Created by twongers.

## The Monk
The Monk is a *(slightly alcoholic)* disciple of ancient martial arts. Store and consume **Ki** to empower your attacks with powerful bonuses! The Monk is a class that requires complex card and resource management to master.

This class adds 3 new keywords to the game. 

**Ki:** Ki is generated through attacks and skills and is eventually expended to imbue your attacks with spiritual magic.

**Discipline:** Cards with discipline have effects that trigger if your remaining energy is used playing the card. 

**Preparation:** Preparation cards subtract some amount of energy from your next turn.

## Requirements ##

#### General Use ####
* Java 8 (JRE). This mod is compatible with Java 8.

## Installation ##
1. If you have `ModTheSpire` already installed you can skip to step 5. Otherwise continue with step 2:
2. Download `ModTheSpire.jar` from the latest release (https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases)
3. Move `ModTheSpire.jar` into your **Slay The Spire** directory. This directory is likely to be found under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire`. Place `ModTheSpire.jar` in that directory so it looks like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\ModTheSpire.jar`
4. Create a `mods` folder in your **Slay The Spire** directory so it looks like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\mods`
5. Download `BaseMod.jar` from the latest release (https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases)
6. Move `BaseMod.jar` into the `mods` folder you created in step 4
7. Download `StSMonkMod.jar` from the latest release (https://github.com/tawong/StS_Monk_Mod/releases)
8. Move `StSMonkMod.jar` into the `mods` folder you created in step 4
9. Your modded version of **Slay The Spire** can now be launched by double-clicking on `ModTheSpire.jar`
10. This will open a mod select menu where you need to make sure that both `BaseMod` and `The Monk Mod` are checked before clicking **play**
