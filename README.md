# StS Monk Mod
Adds an optional 4th playable character to Slay The Spire. Created by twongers.

## The Monk
The Monk is a *(slightly alcoholic)* disciple of ancient martial arts. Store and consume **Ki** to empower your attacks with powerful bonuses! The Monk is a class that requires complex card and resource management to master.

This class adds 3 new keywords to the game. 

**Ki:** Ki is generated through attacks and skills and is eventually expended to imbue your attacks with spiritual magic.

**Discipline:** Cards with discipline have effects that trigger if your remaining energy is used playing the card. 

**Preparation:** Preparation cards subtract some amount of energy from your next turn.
